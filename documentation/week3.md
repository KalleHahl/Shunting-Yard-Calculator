# Week 3
### What I've achieved?
This weeks biggest accomplishment was implementing sin,cos,tan into the calculator. At the moment all the tests have gone through and even longer calculations give the correct answer. 
Floating numbers also caused me a bit of trouble but I managed to make it work. Included codecov and invoke. I haven't yet started to work on the calculator ui since getting the algorithms to work is the hardest part in this project and the ui should be easy to implement. 

### Troubles: 
This week was pretty painless. Implementing the sin,cos,tan functions was at first troublesome but after a bit of pondering I managed to fix the issues I had.
### What I've learned?
Learned about codecov.
### Hours spent:
10
### Goals for next week:
- Start working on a simple version of the ui
- The postfix algorithm is still a bit ugly, so I'll try to make it prettier
- Maybe start to figure ou how to implement a one variable equation into the calculator
