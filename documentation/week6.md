# Week 6
### What I've achieved?
This week I changed the algorithms and other code to use object oriented programming and refactored methods so that single responsibility principle is upheld, as was suggested in my issues. I also added abs function. Most of my time was spent cleaning the project.
### Troubles: 
Little troubles this week, some error messages didn't work at first after changing to object oriented coding but I managed to fix the issues.
### What I've learned?
Learned a lot more unittesting methods.
### Hours spent:
8ish
### Goals for next week:
- Making final touches to the project
