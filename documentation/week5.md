# Week 5
### What I've achieved?
This week I added the possibility to assign values to variables and use them in expressions. The project now has a variables.py file which includes a class for storing them. I also added min and max functions, which can be used with digits and expressions e.g. min(4,5) and max(2^4,2+5). Tried to clean the code and wrote tests.

### Troubles: 
I had a little bit of problems when inputting an expression which had variables, but I managed to solve the issues. I'm still not quite sure if the varaible fetching is done optimally. Otherwise it was a pretty painless week. 
### What I've learned?
While peerreviewing a project I noticed how much easier it is to follow code that uses objects and many small functions.
### Hours spent:
6 ish
### Goals for next week:
- Making sure every input error is covered and the program doesn't break when given an incorrect input.
- Cleaning the code
