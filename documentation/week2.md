# Week 2
### What I've achieved?
This week I coded two algorithms: one which turns an infix equation into a postfix form and one which takes the postfix form and gives the correct value.
I also created a tests folder with unittests for both of the algorithms. Added coverage, pylint and pytest to the project and the ability to run these tests. The file/directory structure has started to properly form.
### Progress:
First versions of algorihtms coded, unittesting, coverage etc
### Testing:
![Coverage](https://github.com/KalleHahl/tiralabra/blob/main/documentation/data/Screenshot%20from%202023-01-29%2020-43-46.png)

Pretty pleased with the coverage. Didnt't have time to get it to 100% but I will try first thing next week-
### Troubles: 
Most of my time this week was spent searching the internet why my imports were not working. I managed to finally get them working by modifying the pyproject.toml file, but i'm still not sure if that will permanently fix the problems for this project. None of the solutions that should work, like adding the init files in directories and using different import methods, were working. I spent somewhere around 20 hours on this issue alone this week.
### What I've learned?
I've learned many things about unittesting and coverage. This is also the first time that I've properly started a project in python so all things regarding project development have been new to me. Also learned the hard way how hard importing modules in python can be.
### Hours spent:
Somewhere around 30 I would say.
### Goals for next week:
- Adding more operators to the algorithm (abs, sin/cos/tan)
- Maybe start working on the interface
- Writing tests as I go
