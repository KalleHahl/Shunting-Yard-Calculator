# Week 1
### What I've done
This week I spent most of my time researching different topics for this course. I finally decided on the subject, created a repository for the project and fiddled with the algorithm logic in a separate file on my computer.
Most of the time was spent researching videos and articles on the algorithm and trying to really understand what's happening in each step of the algo.
### Progress 
I haven't made any concrete progress, beside the mandatory repo stuff, but I did do a lot of studying which will help me in the weeks to come.
### What I've learned
All things related to the shunting yard algorithm
### Troubles
The biggest problem was deciding the subject for this project.
### What next?
Next week I will start setting up the project. I'll most likely start by optimizing the algorithm which I already made. Mandatory stuff for the weekly deadline is obviously a priority.
